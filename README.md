## Fun follow ups

### Folder deletions

Make sure you fetch all of the folders that have it as a parent, and their children too

### Folder creations

Make a server action that takes a name and parentId, and creates a folder with that name and parentId (don't forget to set the ownerId).

### Access control

Check if user is owner before showing the folder page.

### Make a "file view" page

You get the idea. Maybe check out my last tutorial?

### Toasts!

### Gray out a row while it's being deleted
